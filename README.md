# Final_Project
# Descrpiton:
In our project we are dealing with a project in which the aerospace 
industry is integrated, the goal is to compress * executable files with the 
help of algorithms that will be taught in the elective course "Data 
Compression" by Professor Dana Shapira 
## Executable file:
is a file that contains data translated into the program by 
the computer. Typically, the file includes a binary representation of 
machine commands for a particular processor
